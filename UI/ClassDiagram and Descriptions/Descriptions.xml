  This test project allows to save a list of workers, and additional informations, 
  like start salary, current salary, and salary on fixed time. 
  Business logic in ideal case should be written in separate class, but I did not do in this way.
  Bussiness logic implemented, the directly, in inherited classes(Employee, Manager, Sales). And it is so bad.
  In real project I prefer to separate business logic, connect a database, correct the architecture and we can get
  scalable and profitable project.
